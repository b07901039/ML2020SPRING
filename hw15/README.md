# ML HW15 Reinforcement Learning
OpenAI gym's Lunar Lander problem. Train an agent to land the space vehicle on the land.  
## Usage
* ```train.py``` use gradient policy to train an agent, and save total_rewards, final_rewards, model.
* ```train_2.py``` use reinforce with baseline to train an agent, and save total_rewards, final_rewards, model.
* ```test.py``` load model and test the agent TEST_NUM times, and print out mean and std of total_rewards.  
* ```model.py``` agent and network of Policy Gradient and Baseline.
